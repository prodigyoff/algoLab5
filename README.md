# KMP algorithm  
**To run my code:**  
• Download/clone this repository  
• Use command in folder which contains main.py: ```python3 main.py``` (could be "py" or "python" depending on your python version, also you can change inputs in kmp.in) and check results in command line or in kmp.out  
• To launch unittests using console type: ```python3 -m unittest test_kmp.py``` (in the same folder as step before)
